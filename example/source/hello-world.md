## Introduction

`harmonique` is a personal static site generator for a simple blog.


### Code

Here we learn the famous hello world.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello world")
```

This hello world example is the first ritualistic task in the cult of
programming.

## Links and footnotes

Links can also be specified like this:

```markdown
You can search more using [google][1] but there are
other search engines like [bing][bng] or [DuckDuckGo][duck].

[1]: https://google.com/ "Google search"
[bng]: https://bing.com/ "Bing search"
[duck]: https://duckduckgo.com "DuckDuckGo"
```

Footnotes are also very easy:

```markdown
Footnotes are references[^ref]. Manually creating reference
links can be tedious.[^1]

[^1]: https://wikipedia.org
[^ref]: This is note id
```
